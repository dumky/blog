A while back, one of my nephews asked me how computers work. During my recent trip, I spent some time with him to answer that question. I will share this introduction through a few posts.

"How do computers work?" can be answered at many levels, just like "How does life work?". For life, you can explain that there are plant and animals, the interaction of animals, the physical and behavioral attributes of individuals of a specie, the function of different organs in their body, the cellular structure of each organ, or the atomic structure of different types of cells.

For computers, there is a similar hierarchy of abstractions: ecosystem of computers (networks), individual computers formed of large components (screen, keyboard, proceesor, memory) and software, circuits forming processors and memory, and the atomic-size elements (transistors, wires) forming those circuits.

I will mainly focus on the hardware part, starting from the bottom (transistor) and buildling up by assembling simple and small components into more advanced and larger components. I won't discuss the software part much (maybe later). It is useful if the reader has already done a little bit of software programming (mathematical primitives, conditionals, loops, variables, functions/modules), as the computer we will "build" will implement those instructions.
