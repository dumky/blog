The assumption of perfect competition are unrealistic not just because they are extreme (large number of firms, homogenous products,  perfect knowledge), but that they are directionally wrong. In the real world, where we have most competition is where we also have product differentiation.  
Also, in the PC model, there is no rivalry on prices. Incentive for firms to lower prices or innovate have disappeared because of perfect knowledge (they get copied immediately).  
The PC model also implies homogeneity and fungibility of labor.  
To reach it's conclusion (PC production structure produces larger quantity at lowest price), the model also assumes that the cost curve of small firms is the same as that of larger ones. Basically it ignores economies of scale. One can produce one car just as efficiently as one thousand.
