# Content folder

This is where the BlogBuilder reads all of its contents/inputs.
This folder is expected to contain and index.yml file, and also .md files for each blog entry.
The YAML index file contains the metadata: blog information and listing of entries.
The Markdown entry files contain the body of each blog entry.
